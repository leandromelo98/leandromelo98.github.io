The easier way you can be attacked by someone is connecting your laptop to unsecure network or leave your laptop unattended.
The ways I can defend my self is to connect to a secure network or not leaving my laptop unattended on places that I do not know who will be around.
Also I should not keep my personal files in my laptop that I carry around.
